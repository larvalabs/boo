## Boo!

Boo! is an Android Experiment. Cute little creatures crowd the screen. But as soon as they see your face, they all run away! Try sneaking up on them to catch their antics before you are spotted.

The app makes use of the front-facing camera of the device. A face detection algorithm determines if the creatures are being watched. Their movements are governed by spring/mass physics simulations, and they are drawn purely algorithmically with no bitmaps or canned animations.
